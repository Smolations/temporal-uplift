# Temporal Uplift
This is an ElectronJS app built on React. It is a stand-up/sit-down timer. But maybe with super powers.

**VERY MUCH UNDER CONSTRUCTION**

## Spinning up the app:

1. Make sure you install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).
2. Clone this repo.
3. Within repo folder, and with Docker running, open your favorite CLI and:
```
$ docker-compose up
```
4. Visit http://localhost:8080 for the app.
